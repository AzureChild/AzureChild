### < Time to Duel 👊 >

Hey, another face in the crowd here - some people might know me as the Yu-Gi-Oh guy. After spending long years of manual labour and stressing over logistics issues I decided to try and get invested back into technology. Now with some React under my belt I'm here to try and code with the kind of attitude only a disgruntled forklift driver can bring.

I'm a pretty down to earth guy.
